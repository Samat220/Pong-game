# Pong-game
Pong game in python
This is a classic game of pong in python for my university project

If you try to run this code you might need to change values for ball.dx and ball.dy (lines 55 and 56). This changes the speed of the ball.
Speed will depend on your computer, so you need to tune it accordingly.

Thanks.
